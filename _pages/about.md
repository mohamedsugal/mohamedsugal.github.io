I'm currently a Software Engineer within the [Ad Ranking](https://eng.snap.com/machine-learning-snap-ad-ranking) Organization at Snapchat, where I tackle complex challenges associated with the dynamics of the Ad Marketplace, such as auction, pacing, bidding, and forecasting. Concurrently, I am pursuing a part-time Master's degree at the University of Texas at Austin, with a specialization in Computing Systems.

Prior to joining UT Austin, I graduated with a Bachelor' s degree in Computer Science from University of Florida, where I was advised by Professor `Cheryl Resch`. I developed an [Educational Platform](https://github.com/CIS4914) designed specifically for students in East Africa, aiming to enhance their understanding of core Computer Science concepts.
