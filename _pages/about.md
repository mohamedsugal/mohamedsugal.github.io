<h3>About me</h3>
I'm currently a <span class="highlight">Software Engineer</span> within the <a class="highlight" href="https://eng.snap.com/machine-learning-snap-ad-ranking">Ad Ranking Organization</a> at Snapchat, where I tackle complex challenges associated with the dynamics of the Ad Marketplace, such as auction, pacing, bidding, and forecasting. Concurrently, I am pursuing a part-time Master's degree at the University of Texas at Austin, with a specialization in Computing Systems.

Prior to joining UT Austin, I graduated with a Bachelor' s degree in Computer Science from University of Florida, where I was advised by <span class="highlight">Prof. Cheryl Resch</span>. I developed an <a class="highlight" href="https://github.com/CIS4914">Educational Platform</a> designed specifically for students in East Africa, aiming to enhance their understanding of core Computer Science concepts.
