I'm currently a <span class="highlight">Software Engineer</span> within the <a class="highlight" href="https://eng.snap.com/machine-learning-snap-ad-ranking">Ad Ranking Organization</a> at Snapchat, where I tackle complex challenges associated with the dynamics of the Ad Marketplace such as Ad-insertion, ad-load, responsible monetization, and forecasting. Concurrently, I am self learning <span style="font-style: italic;">(part-time)</span> <a class="highlight" href="https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.824/general.html">Distribured Systems</a> by professors Frans Kaashoek & Robert Morris at MIT and <a class="highlight" href="https://www.udemy.com/course/java-multithreading-concurrency-performance-optimization">Java Multithreading, Concurrency & Performance Optimization</a> by Michael Pogrebinsky on Udemy.

Prior to joining Snapchat, I graduated with a Bachelor' s degree in Computer Science from University of Florida, where I was advised by <a class="highlight" href="https://www.eng.ufl.edu/eed/faculty/name/cheryl-resch/">Prof. Cheryl Resch</a>. I developed an [`Educational Platform`](https://github.com/CIS4914) designed specifically for students in East Africa, aiming to enhance their understanding of core Computer Science concepts.
