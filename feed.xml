Representing Snapchat, I was part of the buzz and excitement. Even though we didn't have a stand at the main venue, we hosted our own special event back at Snapchat's office in Austin. It was a hit, attracting AfroTech attendees with lots of networking opportunities and fascinating sessions about Augmented Reality (AR).</p> <p>It was my first time at AfroTech, and I loved every bit of it. The atmosphere was electric with energy and ideas. I dived into networking, learning about the newest tech advancements, and just having a great time meeting and talking to people. Among the many new faces, I bumped into an old friend, Hassan Abdi. We shared memories from our times in Louisville, Kentucky, and it was wonderful to reconnect in such an inspiring setting.</p> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/personal-site/assets/img/mohamed_and_hassan-480.webp 480w,/personal-site/assets/img/mohamed_and_hassan-800.webp 800w,/personal-site/assets/img/mohamed_and_hassan-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/personal-site/assets/img/mohamed_and_hassan.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <div class="caption"> Me and Hassan at AfroTech's reception </div> </div> </div> <p>A real highlight of the conference for me was "The Toolkit to Advancing Your Engineering Career." Maneesh Bhide from Databricks, along with other tech leaders from companies like Grammarly, led this insightful session. They shared valuable advice on how to make it in the tech world, emphasizing not just the technical know-how but also the soft skills and adaptability needed to thrive in places like Silicon Valley. Their stories and tips were a big eye-opener for me about what it takes to grow and succeed in my career.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/personal-site/assets/img/snapnoir-480.webp 480w,/personal-site/assets/img/snapnoir-800.webp 800w,/personal-site/assets/img/snapnoir-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/personal-site/assets/img/snapnoir.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <div class="caption"> SnapNoir team members at Snapchat's Austin office </div> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <p>But one of the most memorable parts of AfroTech was meeting other members of SnapNoir, the employee resource group for Black Snapchat employees. It was fantastic to connect with colleagues who share similar backgrounds and experiences. We exchanged stories, supported each other, and I feel like I've made some long-lasting friendships. It's great to be part of a community within Snapchat that understands and celebrates diversity.</p> </div> </div> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <iframe src="https://awsdatabase.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/google_booth.MP4" class="rounded z-depth-1" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="" width="300px" height="533px" min-width="100px"/> </figure> <div class="caption"> Google's booth at AfroTech </div> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <iframe src="https://awsdatabase.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/snap_office_event.MP4" class="rounded z-depth-1" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="" width="300px" height="533px" min-width="100px"/> </figure> <div class="caption"> Snap event held at Snapchat's Austin office </div> </div> </div> <p>AfroTech wasn't just another conference. It was a celebration of Black talent and innovation in the tech world. I left feeling inspired and motivated, with new friends, a bunch of new ideas, and a renewed excitement for the future of technology. The connections I made and the things I learned are things I'll carry with me as I move forward in my career. I'm already looking forward to next year's event!</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="tech"/><category term="afrotech"/><category term="conference"/><category term="comments"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Attending first AfroTech Conference]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Displaying External Posts on Your al-folio Blog</title><link href="https://mohamedsugal.com/personal-site/blog/2022/displaying-external-posts-on-your-al-folio-blog/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Displaying External Posts on Your al-folio Blog"/><published>2022-04-23T23:20:09+00:00</published><updated>2022-04-23T23:20:09+00:00</updated><id>https://mohamedsugal.com/personal-site/blog/2022/displaying-external-posts-on-your-al-folio-blog</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://mohamedsugal.com/personal-site/blog/2022/displaying-external-posts-on-your-al-folio-blog/"><![CDATA[]]></content><author><name></name></author></entry></feed>
